Jules' Work plan proposals

   + BPF current issue proposed by Daniel Borkmann
                * Move samples/bpf to BPF selftests folder to improve on test_prog BPFci ==> currently ongoing, rewriting the Makefile
                * Require reading on Makefile writing
                * Duration: ongoing - one more week - expected to complete 26th May
                * progress:
                        + moved files, made them compiled correctly in the same directory
                        + challenges :
                                + merging two makefiles into one
                                + Migrates tests from the samples/bpf to selftests/bpf 

   + Create a bcc tool for network statistics using XDP/BPF technology
           + proposed tool to gather statisitics on per ip address connected to network event block an IP if suspicious
        	* Duration: two weeks
                	- 1 week reading xdp documents and practice
                	- 1 week coding
			- 2 days for writing man page fof the tool
                	- expected completion 7th June.

   + Improving the eBPF verifier : work with Wenhui
                + Duration: One Month - starts 6th June
		+ select which issue to work on 
		+ Improve eBPF
		+ Write a test for it 
   + Any other issues assigned by mentor

Işıl's work plan draft

Working on the Gramine issue "Communication with devices" opened by
Dmitrii Kuvaiskii.
     - https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine/issues/353
     - Support communication with hardware accelarators (GPU)

 Main steps:

- Communicate with Gramine maintainers - still in progress (users@gramineproject.io)
- Build and run Gramine project ~2 weeks
     - Dependencies for SGX
     - Dependencies for Gramine
- Read documentation ~2 weeks
- Check GPU support ~1 week
- Try Gramine with a CUDA program ~1 week
- Add CUDA programs if there is support

- Read related work ~ 2 weeks
     - Computation offloading to hardware accelerators in Intel SGX and Gramine Library OS.
