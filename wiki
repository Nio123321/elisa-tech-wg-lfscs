Jules' Work plan proposals

   + BPF current issue proposed by Daniel Borkmann
                * Move samples/bpf to BPF selftests folder to improve on test_prog BPFci ==> currently ongoing, rewriting the Makefile
                * Require reading on Makefile writing
                * Duration: ongoing - one more week - expected to complete 26th May
                * progress:
                        + moved files, made them compiled correctly in the same directory

                                + Migrates tests from the samples/bpf to selftests/bpf 

   + Create a bcc tool for network statistics using XDP/BPF technology
           + proposed tool to gather statisitics on per ip address connected to network event block an IP if suspicious
        	* Duration: two weeks
                	- 1 week reading xdp documents and practice
                	- 1 week coding
			- 2 days for writing man page fof the tool
                	- expected completion 7th June.

   + Improving the eBPF verifier : work with Wenhui
                + Duration: One Month - starts 6th June
		+ select which issue to work on

Işıl's work plan draft

Working on the mystikos project, a runtime and a set of tools for running Linux applications in a hardware trusted execution environment (TEE).
     - https://github.com/deislabs/mystikos

 Main steps:

+ Build and run tests in mystikos, read documentation ~2 weeks
+ Fix a minor issue ~2 weeks
	- After getting comment from contributors, created a pull request: https://github.com/deislabs/mystikos/pull/1404 (17/8)
+ Communicate with maintainers (paul.c.allen@microsoft.com)
- Work in a performance issue: https://github.com/deislabs/mystikos/issues/1052 ~3 weeks
- Extend mystikos with additional system calls or any other feature suggested by maintainers
