## Kernel execution contexts
1. A user application normally runs in unprivileged mode, in user space.  Contexts for execution of kernel code by user applications:
    * Process context - kernel code is executed from a system call or a processor exception (e.g., page fault).  Synchronous
    * Interrupt context - kernel code (e.g., device driver's interrupt handler) is executed from a peripheral chip's HW interrupt.  Asynchronous.
2. Kernel mode threads are application which execute exclusively in kernel space, in process context.

## Kernel and user space stacks
1. Each process in user space has dedicated virtual memory containing the following segments:
    * Text segment - machine code
    * Data setments - global and static data:
      * Initialized data segment
      * Uninitialized data segment (bss), may be auto-initialized to 0 at run-time
      * Heap segment - for dynamic allocation, grows up from lower addresses
      * Libraries (text data) - shared libraries which a process may dynamically link into
      * Stack - Captures high-level lanaguage function calling flow, including call/return sequence, parameter passing, local variable instantiation, return value.
          Stack allocation is architecture dependent, but normally grows down towards lower addresses.  
          A stack frame is allocated and appropriately initialized on every funciton call.
          Details of stack frame layout are architecture dependent, a SP (Stack Pointer) register normally will be used to point to current frame at top of stack
2. Each thread (user as well as kernel) in kernel space has a dedicated task_struct which contains all attributes related to the thread.
3. Each user space thread has 2 stacks, one in user space and a second in kernel space, each of which monitors thread execution when the thread executes in user or kernel space respectively.
4. Kernel space threads have only 1 stack, in kernel space.  The kernel mode stacks are normally fixed size and relatively small.
5. [getrlimit / setrlimit](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html) may be used to get/set resource limits, in particular to set max size of user space stack.
6. A dedicated stack per CPU may be allocated by architecture for interrupt handling, to avoid overloading the kernel mode stack of the thread which was interrupted.

## Seeing is believing
* ps aux   
    * Print list (including pids) of all running processes
* cat /proc/< pid >/stack   
    * Dumps kernel space stack (call frame per line)
* [gstack](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gstack)
    * Outputs user space stack
* [strace()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html)  
    * trace system calls
* [ltrace()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ltrace.1.html)
    * trace library calls
 * ps -LA
   * Prints pid field of task structure (under LWP = LightWeight Process or thread column) and tgid (Thread Group member, which is actually the process id, under PID column)
   * In case process is single thread, pid = tgid.
   * In multithreaded, tgid is unique per thread
 * Code samples:   git clone
   * [current_affairs](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming/tree/master/ch6/current_affairs)
   * [thrd_showall](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming/tree/master/ch6/foreach/thrd_showall)
      * Iterate over tasks in kernel's task lists to display all live processes (using for_each_process() macro), 
      * Or all threads within each process (using the pair of do_each_thread() {...} while_each_thread() macros. 
      * main() thread's current--> mm points to a structure of type mm_struct, which represents the entire process' user space mapping.
      * If current-->mm is NULL, it means this process has no user space mapping so it must be a kernel thread.
